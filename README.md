The term Menu engineering is used within hospitality industry specifically in the context of restaurants but can be applied to any business that displays a list of products or service offerings for consumer choice. Menu engineering provides with information about a menu items’ profitability and popularity so that proactive planning recipe design and customer pricing decisions can be made. A menu items’ margin will tell you how much cash each sale contributes to till you need to know how popular the item is to determine the total cash it contributes to the sales mix. Then characterized each item into one of four groups, a high margin popular item is a star, a horse is an item that sells well but with a relatively low cash contribution, an unpopular item with low contribution margin is considered a dog, finally a puzzle is an item with relatively low sales but a high cash contribution. By engineering your menu you can take each item’s contribution & its popularity into account to determine which of the four categories it falls into you can then create an action plan for each category the goal is to maximize profitability by encouraging customers to buy what you want them to buy.
